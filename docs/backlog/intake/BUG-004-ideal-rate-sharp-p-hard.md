## Raw Request

> (Filed gap 004 of the document gap-analysis (preceding review) from the immediately
> preceding turn; the gap text below is that analysis, not the user's words.)

## Gap (defect statement; document-grounded)
Source: Rem 7.15g; §7.15 open middle.

The exact ideal RNR rate L*_RNR = H(X^N) is #P-hard / FP^#P-complete, and the exact finite-block entropy oracle is #P-hard (only eps-approximable under filter stability, 7.15c). So the optimum the framework targets is not efficiently computable in general. FIX TARGET (mostly characterization): make explicit, wherever the 'ideal rate' is invoked, that it is an intractable target and the operative object is the eps-approximation / achievable scheme.

## Clarification / Assumptions
- This is a GOVERNANCE/DOCUMENTATION-class defect in the theory paper
  `tex/rnr_coding.tex` (no runtime product). "Fix" means: close the proof/empirical
  gap, OR scope the paper's claim to match what is actually established.
- Severity reflects how load-bearing the gap is for the document's MAIN IDEA
  (side-information+repair: neural ratio AND polylog random access).

## Refined Description
**Scope:** the gap above and its FIX TARGET.  **Non-goals:** unrelated §-content.
**Impacted UCs:** N/A (theory paper)
**Impacted BR/WF:** N/A
**Dependencies:** none
**Risks / Open Questions:** see Gap; some fixes need work outside this repo (experiments).
**Expected Code Change:** NO
**Documentation Recovery Required:** NO

## Lifecycle Coverage Map
| Stage | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CLARIFICATION | PENDING | scope the claim vs close the gap |
| ESTIMATION | PENDING | set Complexity/Budget |
| DECOMPOSITION | PENDING | split if proof + empirical both needed |
| DESIGN | PENDING | proof strategy or experiment design |
| FRONTEND | N/A | no UI |
| BACKEND | PENDING | tex edit / proof / probe (or N/A if empirical-only) |
| TESTING | PENDING | scripts/verify probe or measured datum |
| POST_AUDIT | PENDING | adversarial re-review per project review protocol |

## Execution Tracking (§12.11)
**Estimate (hours, before BUILD):** TBD
**Start Timestamp:** TBD
**End Timestamp:** TBD
**Token Stats (per work session):** input: UNKNOWN (not yet worked) ; output: UNKNOWN ; model: UNKNOWN ; level: UNKNOWN

## Compliance Notes
- §12.1.1 (Backlog-File-First): the gap analysis was performed in the immediately
  preceding turn (user request "list the available gaps"), BEFORE this backlog file
  existed; the CodexOfLaws §12 format was read this turn to file compliantly. Flagged
  `Recovered: YES` per §12.1.3; no code/proof change was made to the paper before this file.
- Class: GOVERNANCE/DOCUMENTATION; §6 runtime stages / §7 coverage are class-level N/A.
